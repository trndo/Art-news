                        Creating my art I use an opportunity to reflect nature surrounding me and to explore the
                        possibilities of used materials (thread, cardboard, polyurethane foam, wood, glass,
                        etc.) through different methods of their application. My work Wind was created by
                        capturing a moment on a last winter day. The tree-lined view includes no figures, but
                        gives an easy feeling and understanding of the picture.
                        Wind is an example of my understanding of nature; attempt to visualize the image of the
                        wind using color, texture, and form and to explore the range of possibilities allowed
                        through of the used materials. I think that all my pictures are not made with theory
                        alone; the materials are the vital component. In my pictures I create inspiration from
                        undefined feeling of the universe.
